		<h1>相机</h1>
		<p class="desc">相机的抽象基类. 构建新摄像机时,应始终继承此类.</p>
		<h2>构造函数</h2>
		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<p>
			创建一个新相机.请注意,此类不应直接调用; 你可能想要一个PerspectiveCamera或OrthographicCamera.
		</p>

		<h2>属性</h2>
		<p>有关常见属性,请参阅基础[page:Object3D]类</p>

		<h3>[property:Boolean isCamera]</h3>
		<p>
			Used to check whether this or derived classes are cameras. Default is *true*.<br /><br />

			You should not change this, as it used internally by the renderer for optimisation.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Layers layers]</h3>
		<p>
		The [page:Layers layers] that the camera is a member of. This is an inherited
		property from [page:Object3D].<br /><br />

		Objects must share at least one layer with the camera to be seen
		when the camera's viewpoint is rendered.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 matrixWorldInverse]</h3>
		<p>
			This is the inverse of matrixWorld. MatrixWorld contains the Matrix which has
			the world transform of the Camera.
		</p>

		<h3>[property:Matrix4 projectionMatrix]</h3>
		<p>This is the matrix which contains the projection.</p>


		<h2>Methods</h2>
		<p>See the base [page:Object3D] class for common methods.</p>

		<h3>[method:Camera clone]( )</h3>
		<p>
			Return a new camera with the same properties as this one.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Camera copy]( [param:Camera source], [param:Boolean recursive] )</h3>
		<p>
		Copy the properties from the source camera into this one.
		</p>

		<h3>[method:Vector3 getWorldDirection]( [param:Vector3 target] )</h3>
		<p>
		[page:Vector3 target] — the result will be copied into this Vector3. <br /><br />

		Returns a [page:Vector3] representing the world space direction in which the camera is looking.
		(Note: A camera looks down its local, negative z-axis).<br /><br />
